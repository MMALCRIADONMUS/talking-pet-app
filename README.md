## 🤖 Agent Instructions

The Cursor Background Agent should continue working until ALL tasks are complete. See `.cursor/instructions.md` for detailed continuation prompts if the agent hits limits.

### Quality Assurance Loop
After development is complete, a quality loop ensures perfect code:

1. **Cursor Agent** completes all tasks
2. **Claude Code** performs comprehensive review
3. **Cursor Agent** fixes all identified issues  
4. **Loop continues** until both find NO ERRORS for 2 consecutive rounds

See `.cursor/quality-loop.md` and `.cursor/review-commands.md` for details.
